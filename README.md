## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
This application was an assignment for CS360. I was tasked in completing an application in Android Studio showcasing how sensors work within a mobile device. I was able to tap into the devices sensors and showcase an acceleration tracker, displaying how quickly the device is moving. 

## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
This application was built using one screen. In order to meet the requirements, I had to tap into the devices sensors using Sensor Manager to detect movements from the device. The UI design was simplistic, with the only thing in mind being to display the acceleration of the device to the user. The designs were successful, given that the user can get the information quickly and accurately on one screen.

## How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
To approach coding my application, I reflected back on concepts I learned during the semester in ZyBooks. These gave me a better understanding of how to tap into the devices Sensor Manager, and how to incorporate that into my own code. Using outside resources is a skill I will continue to use on future assignments and projects. 

## How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
To ensure my code was built properly, I tested its funcionality frequently during the development process. Ensuring that the code built and ran after every peice was coded allowed me to avoid bugs and road blocks at the end of the development process.

## Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I always find myself running into roadblocks early on in the development process, during the planning stage. My issues typically arise when I don't have as much experience working with a certain language or tool, and don't have a plan going into developing. To overcome this I typically have to create a wireframe or some sort of visual to help me understand what I'm trying to accomplish.

## In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
Tapping into the sensor of the device was the most stressful, as I'd never worked with these tools prior to this assignment. This process forced me to use outside resources to fully demonstrate the tools ability.
